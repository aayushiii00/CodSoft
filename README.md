## Project Overview

During my internship at Codsoft, I worked on various data science projects, including data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation. Each project demonstrates different aspects of data science, from exploratory data analysis to machine learning model deployment.

##Projects
1. Credit Card Fraud Detection
   This Python-based project implements a machine learning solution to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. Utilizing a dataset of financial transactions, the project employs various algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost to classify transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent. The goal is to enhance security and reduce financial losses by detecting suspicious activities in real-time. Key components include data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, with results visualized to assess model performance.
   
 ##Data
 Datasets used in the projects are stored in respective directories. Ensure that the data files are in the correct format as expected by the code. Some datasets may be large, so make sure to have sufficient storage and processing power.
